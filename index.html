            <h1>Rules & Info</h1>
            <p>
                For the 1-year platformer anniversary, we have decided to start a creator contest!
                <ul>
                    <li>The theme will be Natural Disasters</li>
                    <li>You will have 4 weeks to build and submit your part into the website. The deadline is January 17 at 23:59 UTC</li>
                    <li>Colab entries are allowed (if you win with a collab entry you will have to split the money with the person(s) you worked with)</li>
                    <li>The difficulty of the level should be around hard demon to insane demon</li>
                    <li>The gamemode has to be Platformer</li>
                    <li>There is no restriction on length, but it still needs to have good gameplay, decoration, and atmosphere throughout</li>
                    <li>One entry per person or collab</li>
                    <li>NONG songs are allowed</li>
                    <li>If levels are deemed to not be natural disaster themed, they will not be judged</li>
                </ul>
                Rewards depending on placement are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>#1 - $25 + Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                    <li>#2 - $20 + Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                    <li>#3 - $15 + Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                    <li>#4 - $10 + Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                    <li>#5 - $5 + Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                    <li>#6-#20 - Spot in a future mega collab</li>
                </ul>
                The staff of Pemonlist will be the ones judging the levels. We will be rating them in three different areas on a 10-point scale and then averaging these results into one score. The three different areas are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>Gameplay</li>
                    <li>Decoration</li>
                    <li>Atmosphere</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
